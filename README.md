# Projects
Publicly Available Projects.  Both from school and personal projects.  These are closer to being refined then average private work.

The collection of content in this repository will expand by the end of 2021. I expect to add more content surrounding economic metrics 
and education. 

### My website is located [here](https://andrew-morgan-website.herokuapp.com).

## Purpose: 

This Repo is for projects and files to be shared publicly from my personal projects and website. A significant amount of content will be for:

- Data Science: analysis of various datasets; namely in **R** and **Python** and possibly in Java at a later point.
- Economic Analyses: pet projects that typically analyze economic/income/wealth inequality and effects on economic 
  growth (basically macroeconomics)
- Coding Projects: smaller coding projects that can be run in one's own local setup (ideally); 
  typically **Python** though possibly Java and other languages I wish to improve or learn
- Applications: I may add application source code (though possibly only components)


## Table of Contents:

- [Data Analysis of the CATO Institute's Human Freedom Index](https://github.com/amm414/Projects/tree/master/WrittenPosts/DataAnalyses/HumanFreedomIndex/AnalysisOfHumanFreedomIndex)

- [Sudoku Puzzle: N by N Puzzles](https://github.com/amm414/Projects/tree/master/CodingProjects/Sudoku)

- **Economic Analyses:**
  - [The Overview of the 2008 Housing Bubble and Aftermath](https://github.com/amm414/Projects/tree/master/WrittenPosts/EconomicPapers/HousingCrisis2008)
  - [A Study of the United States' Increasing Human Capital Throughout the 20th Century](https://github.com/amm414/Projects/tree/master/WrittenPosts/EconomicPapers/USAEducation20thCentury)


## Other Repositories:

- CraigVersity: A web application designed to be like Craigslist for universities by a group of 5 (including myself). 
  It allows students, staff, and faculty to post goods, services, opportunities for sale. The application is the 
  prototype for a Software Engineering class from the 2019 Fall Semester at Pitt. 
  The [CraigVersity repository](https://github.com/amm414/CS1530-Software-Engineering-Project) with more information and details!
  
- Agent-Based Modeling: My personal project surrounding my interest in simulating models of individual, autonomous 
  agents interacting. These models (or systems) tend to show how macro-level trends occur naturally through these 
  individual interactions of agents. I hope to create a framework that can be used with different models. This project 
  ties my interests like artificial intelligence, utility theory, optimization theory, statistics, and modeling together
  into a singular project. Learn more at my growing [Agent-Based Modeling repository](https://github.com/amm414/Agent-Based-Modeling).
