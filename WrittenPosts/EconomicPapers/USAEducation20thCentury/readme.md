The folder collecting all relevant material including the paper, sources, graphs, and code.

This paper was initially written in the Fall 2018 course titled **Public Economics**. This course 
analyzed many components of public economic theory from taxes to externalities to 
political economics to public goods to insurance to tax optimality. 

My paper focused on how education within the United States has evolved throughout the 20th Century. 

## Abstract
 
Throughout the 1900's, the United States saw rapid human capital growth which led to significant changes
to the overall economy. Human capital plays a pivotal role in economic growth. As the civilian and working 
population gain better skills, they can use these skills to create more value in a given timeframe, leading 
to economic growth year after year. At the start of the century, the United States was a heavily manufacturing 
country, with a workforce that had limited human capital shown by many individuals not even graduating from 
high school. Shortly after WWI, nearly every teenager was given a chance to finish high school, and the 
teenagers' human capital and graduation rates increased. After WWII, a similar, albeit smaller increase 
occurred with higher education. The second-half of the 1900's showed a gradual and persistent trend of 
more college graduates and an ever-increasing human capital. This ever-increasing human capital allowed 
the United States to move away from manufacturing and move towards service-based industries that 
create more economic output.
