## The Overview of the 2008 Housing Bubble and Aftermath

The folder collecting all relevant material including the paper, sources, graphs, and code.

This paper was initially written in the Fall 2018 course titled
**Proseminar in Monetary and Macroeconomics: Manias, Panics and Depressions**. This course was 
focused on various manias, panics, and depressions throughout history, focusing on the western world.
The largest focus was on the United States economic disturbances since the early 1900's. 

My paper focuses on the housing market bubble that preceded the Great Recession and crash of the stock market in 
2008 within the United States. 

## Abstract

 The role of speculation within the housing market fostered the mania that swept up the financial sector through 
 the early to mid-2000's. The speculators that entered the housing market helped cause an initial increase in 
 price, which would bring more speculators to cash in, driving the price of housing even higher. This mania 
 became self-fulfilling. However, as with all bubbles, they eventually pop. Unfortunately for the United States, 
 some of these speculators were not just retail investors, but large institutional investors. Thus, a financial 
 black hole was created. This black hole threatened the entire financial system in the United States, and 
 therefore the world. This catastrophic event was caused because these institutions believed in the fallacy 
 of "housing prices only go up."
