# Summary of Data Analysis of the Human Freedom Index

This folder contains the summary (PDF) and R code/markdown in the subdirectory. 
I recommend only viewing the report, unless you share my interest of analyzing data.
The code is somewhat documented. The code contains all analyses (even analyses not 
discussed in the report/summary piece on my website).
